A desctop app, which can fill your guitar with a little strange audio effects. When I write "strange", I mean DirectX 8 sound effects kind of "distotion" or else

It's not complited, as I had troubles with output all controllers to the window. I could do it in the simpliest way - just arrange all of them on the form and create slots for every controller(widget). It wasn't interesting for me - I wanted to do it more automaticly, just using one list of effects and several controller lists. I would try my best latter.
